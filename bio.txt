
  Hello there. My name is Matt Rosenfeld. I am a student at the University
  of Maryland, College Park, working towards a B.S. in electrical engineering
  and a minor in computer science. I am interested in a wide range of topics
  related to computer engineering and software development. I hope to continue
  learning about the enormous world of software development and engineering,
  having future experiences narrow down my interests into potential career
  paths. My other interests include music (I have a minor in saxophone
  performance from UMD) and biking (trail riding and light mountain biking).
  If you have questions about me, my work, or my other hobbies, my contact
  information can be found on the contact page.
